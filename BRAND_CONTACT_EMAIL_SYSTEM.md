# Brand Contact Email System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation creates a unified contact system where:

- **All customer inquiries go to Studio inbox** (consistent user experience)
- **Email notifications are sent to brand contact emails** (immediate alerts)
- **Fallback to OmaHub admin** if brand has no contact email set

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

1. **Unified Workflow**: All inquiries in one place (Studio inbox)
2. **Immediate Notifications**: Brands get email alerts for new inquiries
3. **Professional Experience**: Customers get clear expectations
4. **Easy Management**: Brands can manage all inquiries from Studio
5. **Smart Fallbacks**: System handles missing contact information gracefully

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration

Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- File: scripts/add-brand-contact-email-system.sql
-- This adds contact_email field and sets up RLS policies
```

**Or run the Node.js script:**

```bash
node scripts/run-contact-email-migration.js
```

### Step 2: Code Updates

The following files have been updated:

#### **Contact API** (`app/api/contact/route.ts`)

- âœ… Always saves inquiries to Studio inbox
- âœ… Sends email notifications to brand contact emails
- âœ… Falls back to `info@oma-hub.com` if no brand email
- âœ… Returns appropriate success messages

#### **Brand Creation Form** (`app/studio/brands/create/page.tsx`)

- âœ… Added required contact email field
- âœ… Helpful description about notification system
- âœ… Clear fallback explanation

#### **Brand Edit Form** (`app/studio/brands/[id]/page.tsx`)

- âœ… Added contact email field for existing brands
- âœ… Helpful description about the system

#### **Contact UI Components**

- âœ… Updated contact button messaging
- âœ… Clear explanation about Studio inbox
- âœ… Professional appearance

### Step 3: Test the System

1. **Create a new brand** with contact email
2. **Submit contact form** from customer perspective
3. **Check Studio inbox** for the inquiry
4. **Verify email notification** was sent to brand contact email

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### **Contact Form Flow:**

```
Customer fills form â†’ Inquiry saved to database â†’
Email notification sent to brand contact email â†’
Inquiry appears in Studio inbox
```

### **Email Notification Content:**

```
Subject: New Customer Inquiry - [Customer Name]

You have a new inquiry from [Customer Name] about your designs.

Customer Email: [customer@email.com]
Message: [Customer's message]

This inquiry has been saved to your Studio inbox.
You can respond directly to the customer at [customer@email.com].

View all inquiries in your Studio: [Studio Inbox Link]

Best regards,
OmaHub Team
```

### **Fallback System:**

1. **Brand has contact email**: Notification sent to brand email
2. **Brand has no contact email**: Notification sent to `info@oma-hub.com`
3. **Customer message**: Always explains the process clearly
