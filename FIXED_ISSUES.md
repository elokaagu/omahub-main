# OmaHub - Fixed Issues Summary

## Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Database Type Mismatch

- **Problem**: Foreign key constraint error between `products.collection_id` (TEXT) and `collections.id` (UUID)
- **Solution**: Updated SQL script to create products table with collection_id as UUID type
- **Files Created/Changed**:
  - `scripts/create-products-table.sql` - Updated with correct UUID type
  - `scripts/fix-database.sql` - Comprehensive SQL fix script

### 2. Storage Permission Issues

- **Problem**: RLS policy violations when accessing storage buckets
- **Solution**: Created SQL script with correct RLS policies for storage
- **Files Created/Changed**:
  - `scripts/fix-database.sql` - Includes storage RLS policy setup

### 3. Next.js Build Errors

- **Problem**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clientModules')"
- **Solution**: Created scripts to clear Next.js cache
- **Files Created/Changed**:
  - `scripts/fix-nextjs-cache.sh` - Full rebuild script
  - `scripts/quick-fix-nextjs.sh` - Faster cache clearing script

## Created Files

1. **scripts/fix-database.sql**:

   - Comprehensive SQL script that:
     - Creates products table with correct UUID type for collection_id
     - Sets up storage RLS policies
     - Creates proper policies for all tables
     - Attempts to create storage buckets

2. **scripts/fix-nextjs-cache.sh**:

   - Complete Next.js cache fix script that:
     - Stops running Next.js processes
     - Clears all cache directories
     - Reinstalls dependencies
     - Rebuilds the application

3. **scripts/quick-fix-nextjs.sh**:

   - Faster alternative that only clears caches without reinstalling

4. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md**:

   - Updated with new scripts and verification steps

5. **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**:
   - Updated with detailed instructions for fixing each issue

## Deployment Steps

1. Run the comprehensive SQL fix script in Supabase:

   ```bash
   # Copy and run the SQL from scripts/fix-database.sql in the Supabase SQL Editor
   ```

2. Clear Next.js cache:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/quick-fix-nextjs.sh
   ```

3. Restart the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Verify all 19 brands display correctly

5. Deploy to production after verifying local functionality

## Additional Notes

- The original issue showing only 4 brands instead of 19 was likely caused by a combination of:

  1. Storage permission issues blocking image access
  2. Missing products table affecting related queries
  3. Type mismatch in foreign key references

- All 19 brands are correctly stored in the database and should now display properly
- 52 collections are properly stored and should link correctly to brands
- The image repair process successfully updated 18 brand images
