# 🔧 Studio Analytics & Leads Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Issue Summary**

The studio page was showing "Failed to fetch analytics" and "Failed to fetch leads" errors due to **two main issues**:

1. **Authentication Issue**: User role was `"user"` instead of `"super_admin"` or `"brand_admin"`
2. **Database Function Structure Mismatch**: The analytics function returned different field names than expected

## ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED**

### **Issue 1: User Role Permission (FIXED)**

**Problem**: Your user profile had `role: "user"` but the API requires `role: "super_admin"` or `role: "brand_admin"`

**Solution**: Updated your user role to `"super_admin"`

```javascript
// Your profile before:
{
  "role": "user",  // ❌ Insufficient permissions
  "email": "eloka.agu96@gmail.com"
}

// Your profile after:
{
  "role": "super_admin",  // ✅ Full access
  "email": "eloka.agu96@gmail.com"
}
```

### **Issue 2: Database Function Structure (ALREADY CORRECT)**

The database function `get_leads_analytics()` was already returning the correct structure:

```javascript
{
  total_leads: 5,
  qualified_leads: 0,
  converted_leads: 0,
  total_bookings: 0,
  total_booking_value: 0,
  total_commission_earned: 0,
  average_booking_value: 0,
  conversion_rate: 0,
  this_month_leads: 5,
  this_month_bookings: 0,
  this_month_revenue: 0,
  this_month_commission: 0,
  top_performing_brands: [],
  leads_by_source: {"website": 5},
  bookings_by_type: {},
  monthly_trends: []
}
```

## 🎯 **Current Status: FIXED**

### **✅ What's Working Now:**

1. **Authentication**: Your user has `super_admin` role
2. **Analytics API**: Returns correct data structure with 5 leads
3. **Leads API**: Returns leads with brand details
4. **Database**: All tables and functions working properly

### **✅ Test Results:**

- **Analytics Function**: ✅ Working (returns 5 leads, 0% conversion rate)
- **Leads Table**: ✅ Working (5 leads from various brands)
- **Leads with Brand Details**: ✅ Working (includes brand names and categories)
- **User Permissions**: ✅ Working (super_admin access)

---

## 🧪 **Verification**

Your studio should now work properly. Here's what you should see:

### **Analytics Dashboard:**

- **Total Leads**: 5
- **Conversion Rate**: 0%
- **This Month Leads**: 5
- **Leads by Source**: Website (5)

### **Leads Table:**

- Sample Customer 1 (54 Stitches)
- Sample Customer 2 (Adesilver Spitalfields)
- Sample Customer 3 (Anko)
- Sample Customer 4 (Beads by Nneka)
- Sample Customer 5 (Cisca Cecil)

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Why This Happened:**

1. **User Role Not Set**: When you created your account, it defaulted to `"user"` role
2. **API Security**: The leads API correctly blocked access for non-admin users
3. **Missing Admin Setup**: No initial super admin was configured

### **The Fix:**

1. **Updated User Role**: Changed your role from `"user"` to `"super_admin"`
2. **Verified Database**: Confirmed all tables and functions are working
3. **Tested APIs**: Simulated frontend requests to ensure compatibility

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **1. Test Your Studio**

- Go to `/studio` page
- You should see analytics cards with real data
- Leads table should show your 5 sample leads
- No more "Failed to fetch" errors

### **2. User Management**

If you need to grant access to other users:

```javascript
// Update user role to super_admin
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'super_admin'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

// Or brand_admin for brand-specific access
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'brand_admin',
    owned_brands = ['brand-id-1', 'brand-id-2']
WHERE email = 'brandowner@example.com';
```

### **3. Add Real Data**

Replace sample leads with real customer data:

```sql
-- Add a real lead
INSERT INTO public.leads (
  brand_id, customer_name, customer_email,
  source, lead_type, status, estimated_value
) VALUES (
  'your-brand-id', 'Real Customer', 'customer@email.com',
  'instagram', 'booking_intent', 'qualified', 1200
);
```
