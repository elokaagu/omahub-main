# 🔧 Brand Profile Consolidation - Favourite Functionality Fixed

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

OmaHub had **two different brand profile routes** with inconsistent functionality:

- **`/brand/[id]`** ✅ **HAD favourite functionality** (from "explore brands")
- **`/designer/[id]`** ❌ **MISSING favourite functionality** (from product pages)

This caused confusion where users could favourite brands from some locations but not others.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Route Consolidation**
- **Removed duplicate** `/designer/[id]` route completely
- **Consolidated all brand profiles** to use `/brand/[id]` route
- **Single source of truth** for brand profile functionality

### **2. Updated All Brand Links**
- **Collection pages** now link to `/brand/[id]` instead of `/designer/[id]`
- **Favourites page** now links to `/brand/[id]` instead of `/designer/[id]`
- **All brand cards** already correctly linked to `/brand/[id]`
- **Product pages** already correctly linked to `/brand/[id]`

### **3. Consistent Favourite Experience**
- **All brand profile visits** now include the favourite button
- **No more confusion** about where to favourite brands
- **Unified user experience** across the entire platform

## 🔄 **What Was Changed**

### **Files Removed:**
- `app/designer/[id]/page.tsx` ❌
- `app/designer/[id]/ClientBrandProfile.tsx` ❌

### **Files Updated:**
- `app/collection/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated brand links
- `app/favourites/page.tsx` - Updated brand links

### **Files Already Correct:**
- `app/product/[id]/page.tsx` ✅ Already linked to `/brand/[id]`
- `components/ui/brand-card.tsx` ✅ Already linked to `/brand/[id]`
- `components/ui/animated-brand-card.tsx` ✅ Already linked to `/brand/[id]`
- `app/brand/[id]/ClientBrandProfile.tsx` ✅ Already had favourite functionality

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After the consolidation:

- ✅ **All brand profile visits** will show the favourite button
- ✅ **Consistent navigation** from any location to brand profiles
- ✅ **No more duplicate routes** causing confusion
- ✅ **Unified favourite experience** across the platform
