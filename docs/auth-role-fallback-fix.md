# Authentication Role Fallback Fix

## Issue Description

Users were experiencing an issue where they would login to super admin, brand admin, or admin accounts successfully, but then the account would "fall into a default user account" until they refreshed the page. This was causing significant usability problems for administrators.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was located in the `AuthContext.tsx` file in the fallback logic for handling profile loading errors. When there were network timeouts, database connection issues, or other temporary errors during profile loading, the system would create a "basic user" object with a hardcoded `role: "user"` instead of determining the correct role based on the user's email.

### Problematic Code Locations

1. **Line 130-138**: When no profile was found, created basic user with `role: "user"`
2. **Line 148-156**: When profile loading timed out or had network errors, created basic user with `role: "user"`

This meant that admin accounts would temporarily appear as regular user accounts until the profile could be successfully loaded from the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Helper Functions

Added two helper functions to the `AuthContext.tsx` to properly determine user roles and owned brands based on email addresses:

```typescript
// Helper function to determine role based on email
const getRoleFromEmail = (email: string): UserRole => {
  if (
    email === "eloka.agu@icloud.com" ||
    email === "shannonalisa@oma-hub.com"
  ) {
    return "super_admin";
  }
  if (email === "eloka@culturin.com") {
    return "brand_admin";
  }
  return "user";
};

// Helper function to get owned brands based on email
const getOwnedBrandsFromEmail = (email: string): string[] => {
  if (email === "eloka@culturin.com") {
    return ["ehbs-couture"];
  }
  return [];
};
```

### 2. Updated Fallback Logic

Modified both fallback scenarios to use proper role detection:

**When no profile is found:**

```typescript
// If no profile exists, create a basic user object with proper role detection
const userEmail = email || "";
const role = getRoleFromEmail(userEmail);
const ownedBrands = getOwnedBrandsFromEmail(userEmail);

const basicUser: User = {
  id: userId,
  email: userEmail,
  first_name: "",
  last_name: "",
  avatar_url: "",
  role: role,
  owned_brands: ownedBrands,
};
```

**When profile loading fails due to timeout/network errors:**

```typescript
// Don't set user to null on timeout or temporary errors - create basic user with proper role instead
const userEmail = email || "";
const role = getRoleFromEmail(userEmail);
const ownedBrands = getOwnedBrandsFromEmail(userEmail);

const basicUser: User = {
  id: userId,
  email: userEmail,
  first_name: "",
  last_name: "",
  avatar_url: "",
  role: role,
  owned_brands: ownedBrands,
};
```

### 3. Added UserRole Import

Added the `UserRole` type import to fix TypeScript compilation:

```typescript
import { getProfile, User, UserRole } from "@/lib/services/authService";
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Eliminates Role Fallback**: Admin accounts no longer fall back to regular user accounts during temporary loading issues
2. **Maintains Proper Permissions**: Users retain their correct permissions even during network issues
3. **Better User Experience**: No more need to refresh the page to restore admin privileges
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Role determination is now consistent across all authentication scenarios

## Testing

The fix has been tested with:

- Build compilation (✅ passes)
- Role detection logic verification (✅ all test cases pass)
- TypeScript type checking (✅ no errors)

## Affected User Accounts

This fix specifically addresses issues for:

- `eloka.agu@icloud.com` (super_admin)
- `shannonalisa@oma-hub.com` (super_admin)
- `eloka@culturin.com` (brand_admin with ehbs-couture brand)

## Future Considerations

For scalability, consider:

1. Moving role/brand mappings to environment variables or database configuration
2. Implementing a more robust role detection system that doesn't rely on hardcoded email addresses
3. Adding role-based caching to reduce database queries

## Status

✅ **Fixed**: Authentication role fallback issue resolved
✅ **Tested**: Build and logic verification completed
✅ **Deployed**: Ready for production use
