# Super Admin Product Image Upload Permissions

## Overview

This document confirms that super admins have the necessary permissions to upload product images in the OmaHub platform.

## ✅ Verified Configurations

### 1. Database Schema

- **Role Constraint**: The `profiles` table properly supports the `super_admin` role
- **Valid Roles**: `user`, `admin`, `super_admin`, `brand_owner`
- **Current Super Admins**: 3 users with super_admin role found in the system

### 2. FileUpload Component Permissions

- **Location**: `components/ui/file-upload.tsx`
- **Permission Check**: Lines 108-112 correctly check for super_admin role
- **Allowed Roles for Product Uploads**:
  - `super_admin` ✅
  - `admin` ✅
  - `brand_owner` ✅

### 3. Storage Bucket Configuration

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### Role Name Consistency

- **Issue**: FileUpload component was checking for `brand_admin` role
- **Fix**: Updated to check for `brand_owner` role to match database schema
- **Files Modified**: `components/ui/file-upload.tsx`

### Error Message Clarity

- **Issue**: Error message didn't mention super_admin role
- **Fix**: Updated error message to include all authorized roles
- **New Message**: "Only super admins, admins, and brand owners can upload product images"

## 🎯 Result

**Super admins now have full permissions to upload product images!**

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### For Super Admins:

1. Log in with your super admin account
2. Navigate to any page with a FileUpload component
3. Set the `bucket` prop to `"product-images"`
4. Upload images normally - the component will automatically verify your permissions

### Example Usage:

```tsx
<FileUpload
  bucket="product-images"
  onUploadComplete={(url) => console.log("Uploaded:", url)}
  accept="image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp"
  maxSize={10}
/>
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If uploads still fail:

1. **Check User Session**: Ensure the user is properly authenticated
2. **Verify Role**: Confirm the user has `super_admin`, `admin`, or `brand_owner` role
3. **Storage Policies**: If needed, run the storage policies setup script:
   ```sql
   -- See scripts/setup-product-images-policies.sql
   ```
