# Studio Admin Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Super Admin Role Assignment Logout Bug âœ…

**Problem**: When assigning someone as super admin, it would log out the current admin user (though the role was still applied).

**Root Cause**: The real-time profile update notification system was sending updates to all users, including the admin making the change. This caused session conflicts and forced logouts.

**Solution**: Modified `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` to prevent self-logout:

- Added check to skip real-time notifications when admin updates their own profile
- Prevents session invalidation during role assignments
- Role updates still work correctly, but admin stays logged in

**Code Change**:

```javascript
// Only send real-time notification if the updated user is not the current admin
// This prevents the admin from logging themselves out when assigning roles
if (updatedUser.id !== user.id) {
  // Send notification...
} else {
  console.log(
    "ðŸ”„ Skipping real-time notification for self-update to prevent logout"
  );
}
```

### 2. Nnamdi Super Admin Access âœ…

**Problem**: Nnamdi should have super admin access but when he clicks on studio it takes him to the homepage.

**Root Cause**: Nnamdi's email (`nnamdiohaka@gmail.com`) was not included in the super admin email lists across the permission services.

**Solution**: Added Nnamdi's email to all super admin lists:

- `lib/services/permissionsService.ts`
- `lib/services/permissionsService.server.ts`
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `lib/services/authService.ts`

**Verification**: Ran verification script - Nnamdi already has super_admin role in database and should now have full studio access.

### 3. Studio Scrolling Glitch âœ…

**Problem**: Sometimes the screen flashes or bounces back to the top when scrolling through content on the studio part.

**Root Cause**: Layout shifts during loading states and navigation transitions were causing scroll position jumps.

**Solutions Applied**:

1. **Improved Loading States**: Replaced generic loading spinners with skeleton loaders that maintain layout dimensions
2. **Navigation Scroll Preservation**: Modified navigation component to preserve scroll position during studio navigation
3. **Layout Stabilization**: Added CSS properties to prevent layout shifts:
   - `willChange: 'auto'`
   - `transform: 'translateZ(0)'`
   - `backfaceVisibility: 'hidden'`
4. **Smooth Scrolling**: Added `scrollBehavior: 'smooth'` to studio layout
5. **Minimum Height Containers**: Ensured content containers maintain consistent heights during loading

**Code Changes**:

- `app/studio/layout.tsx`: Improved loading states and layout stability
- `app/studio/page.tsx`: Skeleton loading instead of centered spinner
- `components/ui/navigation-link.tsx`: Scroll position preservation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test super admin role assignment (should not log out admin)
- [ ] Verify Nnamdi can access studio with full permissions
- [ ] Test studio navigation without scroll jumping
- [ ] Verify loading states don't cause layout shifts
- [ ] Test studio access for all admin roles (super_admin, admin, brand_admin)

## Super Admin Users

Current super admin emails with full studio access:

- `eloka.agu@icloud.com`
- `shannonalisa@oma-hub.com`
- `nnamdiohaka@gmail.com` âœ… (newly added)

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes in the development environment
2. Verify Nnamdi can successfully access studio
3. Confirm no more logout issues when assigning roles
4. Monitor for any remaining scrolling issues

All fixes have been implemented and are ready for testing.
