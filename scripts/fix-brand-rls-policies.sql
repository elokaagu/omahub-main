-- Fix RLS policies for brands table to work with the application's permission system
-- This script addresses the issue where brand updates are failing due to restrictive RLS policies

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for all users" ON brands;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for admins only" ON brands;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for admins and brand owners" ON brands;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for admins only" ON brands;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view brands" ON brands;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert brands" ON brands;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own brands" ON brands;

-- Create new, more permissive policies that work with the application layer permissions

-- Allow everyone to read brands (public access)
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to brands"
  ON brands FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert brands (application will handle permission checks)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert brands"
  ON brands FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to update brands (application will handle permission checks)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update brands"
  ON brands FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete brands (application will handle permission checks)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete brands"
  ON brands FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Verify the policies are created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'brands';
